ðŸ”§ Continuing My VLSI Design Journey with Cadence Virtuoso ðŸ§ âš¡

As I deepen my understanding of CMOS design, I recently completed the implementation of a CMOS NOR gateâ€”adding to the series of logic gates Iâ€™ve been designing and simulating.

Hereâ€™s what this step involved:
âœ… Created the schematic for the 2-input CMOS NOR gate
âœ… Generated its symbol to use in hierarchical designs
âœ… Verified correct behavior through transient and DC analysis
âœ… Designed the layout while adhering to design rules // PENDING
âœ… Performed DRC and LVS checks â€” all passed successfully //PENDING
âœ… Completed the extracted view for post-layout simulation //PENDING

Each circuit I work on sharpens my skills in schematic capture, layout editing, and verification â€” reinforcing the complete custom design flow using Cadence. Itâ€™s exciting to see theory come to life through tools like these!

Making the most of this vacation by learning and applying concepts practically â€” one gate at a time.
