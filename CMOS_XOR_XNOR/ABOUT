ðŸ”„ Diving Deeper into Digital Design with an XOR & XNOR in Cadence Virtuoso! ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

Building on my experience with basic logic gates, I recently implemented an SR Flip-Flop using Cadence Virtuoso â€” a fundamental sequential circuit that plays a critical role in memory and control logic design.

Hereâ€™s what I worked on:
âœ… Designed the schematic of the SR Flip-Flop using CMOS logic
âœ… Created a custom symbol for hierarchical circuit integration
âœ… Simulated the circuit using transient analysis to validate its bistable behavior
âœ… Performed DC analysis to study switching thresholds
This project helped reinforce my understanding of state-based digital circuits and gave me hands-on experience translating theory into practical layout design.

Spending my vacation on these meaningful builds has been a great way to stay engaged and keep learning! On to more complex circuits next. ðŸš€
