🚀 Stepping into the World of VLSI Design with Cadence! 🧠⚙️

During this vacation, I decided to dive into something I've always been curious about – CMOS circuit design using Cadence Virtuoso. I'm thrilled to share that I successfully designed, simulated, and laid out my first CMOS NAND gate!

🔧 Here's what I accomplished:
✅ Designed the schematic for a 2-input CMOS NAND gate
✅ Created its symbol for hierarchical use
✅ Verified its functionality using transient and DC analysis in simulation
✅ Built the layout from scratch
✅ Performed DRC and LVS checks – with zero errors!
✅ Generated the extracted view for post-layout simulation

This experience not only helped me understand the practical workflow of digital circuit design but also showed how powerful tools like Cadence can be in translating theoretical knowledge into silicon-level design.

📚 A fulfilling way to make use of my vacation – learning, building, and pushing boundaries!
Excited for what lies ahead in the journey of VLSI and digital design! 💡
